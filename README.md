# React Basics Practice

This project contains basic React components built to demonstrate understanding of props, state, and event handling.

## Components

### 1. WelcomeCard
Displays a greeting message using a `name` from student passed as a prop.

### 2. Counter
Interactive counter that uses React's `useState` to increment, decrement, and reset the value.

### 3. StudentInfo
A simple form that captures student name, age, and course, and shows an alert on submit.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
